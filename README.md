Welcome to badger! Named after the Nim mascot, the honey badger, this keyboard
firmware is written entirely from scratch using Nim. Currently it only targets
the Teensy 2.0 controller and all development is being live-streamed and
recorded for later upload. The goal of this firmware is to create something
that's very easily configured, expanded, and tuneable to your preferences, all
while using Nims great features to make a really small and efficient build.

NOTE: The badger with crown at the beginning is the Nim mascot wearing the Nim
crown. It is the inspiration for the name of this project, but not really its
logo.
