Welcome to badger! Named after the Nim mascot, the honey badger, this keyboard
firmware is written entirely from scratch using Nim. Currently it only targets
the Teensy 2.0 controller and all development is being live-streamed and
recorded for later upload. The goal of this firmware is to create something
that's very easily configured, expanded, and tuneable to your preferences, all
while using Nim's great features to make a really small and efficient build.

As mentioned the entire progress is being live-streamed, if you want to check
out the edited recording you can find them here:

you want to see the un-edited versions they are linked to in the description of
each episode, and has their own hidden playlist in their description.

NOTE: The badger with crown at the beginning is the Nim mascot wearing the Nim
crown. It is the inspiration for the name of this project, but not really its
logo.
